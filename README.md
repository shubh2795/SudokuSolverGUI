I started this project to learn some of the most important object oriented software development techniques.
The code relates to more of functional programming and eventually helps to create JavaFx applications.
This project was assigned in one of the courses that i took and the implementation of the algorithm to solve the sudoku puzzle is taken from one of the CMU or Cornell papers.
